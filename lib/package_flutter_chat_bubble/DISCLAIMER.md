This is the Flutter package `flutter-chat-bubbles` for creating chat bubbles. However, the package was not null-safety compatible (^Dart v2.9), and as such several minor modifications have been made to conform to null-safety standards.

As only parts of the plugin are used in this project, some files are left out, and dead code paths have been commented out.

**We take NO credit for this work.**
